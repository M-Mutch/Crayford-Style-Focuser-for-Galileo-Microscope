Thanks and acknowledgements
Thanks to Maff, who desinged the Hadley telescope (Metric version). Building and using a Hadley has been the
inspiration that made me think this might be possible, and the design itself of the microscope is directly inspired by 
Hadley and the ecosystem of mods that grew around it.

Fun Fact
While I was looking for a name to this project, I found out that Italian scientist Galileo Galilei is credited with the
idea of reversing a telescope and using it as a microscope, and that his first composite microscope design is a 
vertical tube resting on three thin metal legs... apparently the name had found me.

Thanks to the Hadley discord community, especially @Maff, @Baker and @Marci who encouraged me down this road 
after seeing the first render that was, at that point, still half a joke in my head. They also pointed, and accompanied 
me, to the next chapter of my acknowledgements.

Thanks to the Microscopy discord community, in particular @SmarmyNarwal and @Blekenbleu who explained many 
things to me without patronizing even if I was literally an incompetent barging in with ideas. They helped me 
understand what I would be aiming for, what challenges I should prioritize, and how far the mark still is.
